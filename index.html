# Ciphers
## Goal: No one can read your message except the person you intend

# Ciphers
## Goal: No one can read your message except the person you intend

## Examples
  * Hashes: SHA, MD5 (check file integrity)
  * Ciphers: 3DES, AES (are Psuedo Random Permutations)

---

# Integrity
## Goal: No one can forge messages from you

---

# Integrity
## Goal: No one can forge messages from you

## Examples
  1. MAC (message authentication code) and many varieties
  1. We'll see real things that use this next...

# Authenticated Encryption
## Goal: Can't read and can't forge

---

# Authenticated Encryption
## Goal: Can't read and can't forge

## Examples
  1. Algorithm AES-GCM
  1. SSL/TLS (MAC then encrypt)
  1. IPSEC (encrypt then MAC)
  1. SSH (encrypt and MAC)

# Key Exchange
## Goal: Get a secret key to your recipient securely in the first place

# Key Exchange
## Goal: Get a secret key to your recipient securely in the first place

  * Merkel Puzzles (1974)
    * Alice sends a bunch of weakly encrypted messages to Bob
    * Bob solves one, sends solution to Alice
    * They both use that key!
    * Alice and Bob's work: O(n)
    * Attacker's work: O(n^2)

  * Factoring large primes (Diffie-Hellman)
    * Same idea!

  * Public Key Encryption
    * Public key encrypts, secret key decrypts

## Examples

  1. Diffie-Hellman
  1. Public Key Encryption
    * RSA, HTTPS

# Web Crypto
## All of the above, in the browser

# Web Crypto
## All of the above, in the browser

  * Good
    * Netflix!
      * And other necessary DRM evils
    * Sites that secure users' data against themselves
      * Mega, credit card info
      * Protecting a website's own interests (not the user's)

      * Mega
  * Bad
    * DRM
    * You can't trust javascript, and if you could, you wouldn't need encryption
